    "### Introduction\n",
    "Coronary heart disease (or coronary artery disease, CAD) is a chronic heart condition characterized by obstruction of blood flow to the heart due to cholesterol and degenerative tissue plaque buildup (arteriosclerosis) in the coronary arteries. This disease causes oxygen and nutrient deficiency in the heart, leading to chest pain (angina pectoris) and heart attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "As this is an irreversible and incurable condition, it is important to diagnose the disease as quickly as possible to slow the progression of the disease, proloning the patient’s life expectancy. Our chosen dataset observes the outputs of many variables, which may play a role in diagnosing the disease and its progression in a number of patients (such as age and serum cholesterol content) according to our hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are curious to see the ways in which the variable helps us accurately diagnosing CAD, and to create a model that predicts CAD presence/progression in patients with high accuracy based on trends observed in the dataset. Additionally, we hope to identify a threshold or litmus in the variables to help in quantifying the likelihood of CAD presence/progression. We hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between age and the other variables in the dataset, and that this relationship contributes to a higher likelihood of CAD presence. "

    "### Method\n",
    "Our objective is to conduct a multiclass classification with more than two categories to answer a predictive question: can we use the attributes of the patient available to us to predict and distinguish the presence of heart disease in the patient? Our Class will be num, the diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) ranging from 0 to 4:\n",

    "3. cp: chest pain type\n",
    "   * Value 1: typical angina\n",
    "   * Value 2: atypical angina\n",
    "   * Value 3: non-anginal pain\n",
    "   * Value 4: asymptomatic\n",
    "4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",

    "7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results\n",

    "    * Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\n",
    "    * Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria\n",

    "\n",
    "To Summarize:\n",
    "Our data analysis will be conducted using a classification model, and visualized with scatter plots. Our classifier will be the “num” column, which classifies the diagnosis of heart disease progression from 0 to 4 (0 being no presence, 4 being highly progressed). The predictors for the dataset that we will use have been narrowed down to four at present: age, serum cholesterol content (chol), maximum heart rate (thalach), and the number of major vessels visible by fluoroscopy (ca). We have initially chosen these variables given that they have numerical outputs and thus provide a good foundation for drafting a classification model; furthermore, they are highly relevant factors of  CAD and are expected to play major roles in achieving our objective of accurately diagnosing CAD. We hope to be able to increase the number of our predictors with further exploration of this project. "

    "### Expected outcomes and significance\r",
    "We expect to see a general trend in the data where an increase or positive deviation in most variables (e.g. age, serum cholesterol, etc.) is positively correlated with progression of CAD and with each other. For example, we expect to see that serum cholesterol content  is positively correlated with maximum heart rate, and that positive deviation in both these variables is correlated with the presence/progression of CAD. We also expect that these positive correlations are in turn increasingly positively  correlated with the presence/progression of CAD. The impact of these findings would be significant with regards to identifying a definite threshold or litmus in these variables, which could be extremely helpful in outlining a more concrete and reliable method of diagnosing CAD.D.\r\n"
