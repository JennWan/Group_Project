We selected predictors based on expected relevance to our thesis, which was to explore the correlation between the dataset’s given attributes and coronary artery disease (CAD).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Type of chest pain (__cp__)\n",

    "> * __*angina*__ = typical angina, where the patient experiences normal anginal symptoms\n",
    "> * __*abnang*__ = atypical angina, where the patient experiences abnormal anginal symptoms\n",

However, serum cholesterol is made up of different types of cholesterol, some of which are actually indicative of individual health and help to eliminate cholesterol build up. The dataset only provides values for total cholesterol levels; thus, we only analyze the relationship between _total_ cholesterol and CAD.\n",

Having a fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL or higher is an indicator of prediabetes - a condition where insulin is increasingly overproduced in the body and puts the patient at a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiac diseases and stroke; type 2 diabetes is confirmed at a fasting blood sugar level of at least 125 mg/dL. The researchers of this dataset have categorized patients as either:\n",

As the dataset exhibits a relatively late age range (early 30s - late 70s) and investigates attributes that seem to be directly involved with the heart, we have assumed that the dataset defines \"heart disease\" as CAD.\n",

The remaining attributes (__sex, restecg, exang, oldpeak, slope,__ and __thal__) were excluded from our model due to perceived irrelevance and/or insufficient information for interpretation, and thus are not elaborated on in our report.
